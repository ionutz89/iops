# Cloudflare Deployment Configuration Summary

## Objective
Ensure documentation files (DEPLOYMENT.md, README.md, PROJECT_SUMMARY.md, etc.) are **NOT** deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

## Solution Implemented

### Files Created

1. **`.wranglerignore`** (Primary deployment filter)
   - Controls what Wrangler CLI excludes during deployment
   - Blocks all `.md` files from being uploaded
   - Excludes development files, tests, and source code

2. **`.cloudflareignore`** (Secondary safety layer)
   - Additional protection for Cloudflare deployments
   - Excludes source directories (app/, components/, lib/)
   - Blocks configuration files

3. **`DEPLOYMENT_EXCLUSIONS.md`** (Documentation)
   - Comprehensive guide on deployment exclusions
   - Explains how the system works
   - Security benefits and best practices

4. **`.wranglerignore-README.md`** (Quick reference)
   - Short guide for developers
   - Verification commands
   - Examples of adding new exclusions

## How It Works

### Deployment Flow
```
npm run build
    ↓
Creates .open-next/ directory (optimized build)
    ↓
Wrangler reads .wranglerignore
    ↓
Excludes *.md, source files, configs
    ↓
Deploys ONLY .open-next/worker.js + assets/
    ↓
Cloudflare Workers (production)
```

### What's Deployed ✅
- `.open-next/worker.js` - Cloudflare Worker script
- `.open-next/assets/` - Static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images)

### What's NOT Deployed ❌
- `*.md` - All markdown documentation
- `app/` - Source TypeScript/React files
- `components/` - Source component files
- `lib/` - Source utility files
- `node_modules/` - Dependencies
- Configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, etc.)
- Environment files (`.env*`)
- Test files (`*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`)

## Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Check what will be excluded
cat iops-website/.wranglerignore

# 2. Dry-run deployment (see what would be uploaded)
cd iops-website
wrangler deploy --dry-run

# 3. Verify no .md files in build
find .open-next -name "*.md"
# Should return nothing

# 4. Check deployment size
du -sh .open-next/

# 5. Verify markdown files exist in source
ls -la *.md
# Should show all documentation files
```

## Key Benefits

1. **🔒 Security**: Source code and configs not exposed
2. **⚡ Performance**: Smaller worker bundle size
3. **💰 Cost**: Reduced bandwidth and storage
4. **🎯 Clean Deployment**: Only production assets uploaded
5. **📦 Optimized**: Stays under Cloudflare 10MB worker limit

## Documentation Files Protected

All of these remain in git but are NOT deployed:
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- ✅ `README.md`
- ✅ `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md`
- ✅ `SETUP.md`
- ✅ `CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_MIGRATION.md`
- ✅ `IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT_EXCLUSIONS.md`
- ✅ `.wranglerignore-README.md`

## Testing

Before deploying to production:

```bash
cd iops-website

# 1. Build locally
npm run build

# 2. Test with preview
npm run preview
# Visit http://localhost:8787

# 3. Check build output size
du -sh .open-next/

# 4. Dry-run deployment
wrangler deploy --dry-run

# 5. Deploy to production (when ready)
npm run deploy
```

## File Locations

```

    ├── .wranglerignore              ← Deployment exclusions
    ├── .cloudflareignore            ← Additional safety
    ├── .wranglerignore-README.md    ← Quick reference
    ├── DEPLOYMENT_EXCLUSIONS.md     ← Full documentation

        └── assets/                  ← Static files ✓
```

## Maintenance

When adding new documentation:
1. Create the `.md` file (e.g., `NEW_FEATURE.md`)
2. It's automatically excluded by `*.md` pattern
3. No changes needed to `.wranglerignore`

When adding new file types to exclude:
1. Edit `.wranglerignore`
2. Add the pattern (e.g., `*.pdf`)
3. Commit to git
4. Test with `wrangler deploy --dry-run`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Configuration complete
2. Test deployment: `npm run preview`
3. Verify exclusions: `wrangler deploy --dry-run`
4. Deploy to production: `npm run deploy`

## Related Commands

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Local preview (includes all files)
npm run dev

# Preview deployment (uses .wranglerignore)
npm run preview

# Deploy to Cloudflare
npm run deploy

# Check Wrangler status
wrangler whoami

# View deployments
wrangler deployments list
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All documentation files are now properly excluded from Cloudflare Workers deployment while remaining accessible in the git repository for development purposes.
