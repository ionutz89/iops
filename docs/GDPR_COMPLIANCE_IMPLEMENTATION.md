# GDPR Compliance Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 31, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

This document summarizes the full GDPR compliance implementation for the IOPS website, ensuring that all cookies and third-party services are loaded only after explicit user consent, in accordance with GDPR and ePrivacy Directive requirements.

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Privacy Policy Updates (`app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`)

#### Added Calendly as Third-Party Processor
- **Section 7: Data Sharing and Third Parties**
  - Added Calendly entry with details about data processing
  - Mentioned data transfer to United States under Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)
  - Included link to Calendly's privacy policy

#### Enhanced Cookie Section
- **Section 8: Cookies and Tracking Technologies**
  - Reorganized cookie categories:
    - **Essential Cookies**: Always enabled (Cloudflare Turnstile, security, session management)
    - **Functional Cookies**: Calendly and similar services (requires consent)
    - **Analytics Cookies**: Google Analytics (requires consent, disabled by default)
    - **Preference Cookies**: Theme selection, cookie consent choices (optional)
  - Added clear statement that analytics, functional, and marketing cookies only activate after user consent
  - Mentioned "Manage Cookies" link in footer for preference management

#### Technical Changes
- Converted page to client component (`"use client"`) to support interactive cookie management button
- Added "Manage Cookie Preferences" button in footer
- Removed static metadata export (not compatible with client components)

---

### 2. GDPR Consent Library (`lib/gdpr-consent.ts`)

#### New Types and Interfaces
```typescript
export interface CookiePreferences {
  essential: boolean;   // Always true, required for site functionality
  functional: boolean;  // Calendly and similar services
  analytics: boolean;   // Google Analytics, etc.
  marketing: boolean;   // Marketing and advertising cookies
}
```

#### New Storage Keys
- `cookiePreferences`: Stores granular cookie preferences in localStorage

#### New Functions

**Preference Management:**
- `getCookiePreferences()`: Retrieves saved cookie preferences
- `setCookiePreferences(preferences)`: Saves preferences and loads/removes scripts accordingly

**Calendly Script Management:**
- `loadCalendlyScripts()`: Dynamically loads Calendly widget script and CSS
- `removeCalendlyScripts()`: Removes Calendly scripts and clears global object

**Enhanced Functions:**
- `clearConsentStatus()`: Now also clears preferences and removes Calendly scripts
- `setCookiePreferences()`: Automatically manages script loading based on preferences

#### Event System
- Dispatches `cookiePreferencesChanged` event when preferences are updated
- Maintains existing `gdprConsentChanged` event for backward compatibility

---

### 3. Cookie Consent Modal (`components/GdprConsent.tsx`)

#### Complete Redesign
- **Two-stage consent interface:**
  1. **Simple Banner**: Quick accept/reject with "Manage Preferences" option
  2. **Detailed Modal**: Granular control over each cookie category

#### Features

**Simple Banner (Initial View):**
- Clear message about essential vs. optional cookies
- Three action buttons:
  - "Accept All" (green) - Enables all cookies
  - "Reject Non-Essential" (gray) - Only essential cookies
  - "Manage Preferences" (outline) - Opens detailed modal
- Link to Privacy Policy

**Detailed Preferences Modal:**
- **Essential Cookies**: Always active badge (cannot be disabled)
- **Functional Cookies**: Toggle switch for Calendly
- **Analytics Cookies**: Toggle switch for Google Analytics
- **Marketing Cookies**: Shown as "Not Used" (disabled)
- Custom toggle switches with smooth animations
- "Save Preferences" and "Accept All" buttons
- Close button to return to simple banner

#### User Experience
- Full-screen overlay with backdrop blur
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)
- Accessible with ARIA labels
- Remembers user choice in localStorage
- Can be reopened via "Manage Cookies" link

#### Event Handling
- Listens for `openCookiePreferences` event to reopen modal
- Dispatches preference changes to update scripts in real-time

---

### 4. Analytics Loader (`components/analytics-loader.tsx`)

#### Enhanced Functionality
- Now handles both analytics AND Calendly scripts
- Checks granular cookie preferences
- Loads scripts only when user has consented to specific categories

#### Implementation
```typescript
// Checks both consent status and granular preferences
if (preferences.analytics) {
  loadAnalyticsScripts();
}
if (preferences.functional) {
  loadCalendlyScripts();
}
```

#### Event Listeners
- `gdprConsentChanged`: Responds to overall consent changes
- `cookiePreferencesChanged`: Responds to granular preference updates

---

### 5. Footer Updates (`app/page.tsx`)

#### Added "Manage Cookies" Link
- Placed in "Connect" section of footer
- Triggers `openCookiePreferences` event on click
- Styled consistently with other footer links
- Interactive button element (not a link)

#### Implementation
```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => {
    window.dispatchEvent(new Event("openCookiePreferences"));
  }}
  className="text-foreground hover:text-primary transition-colors text-left"
>
  Manage Cookies
</button>
```

## Maintenance Notes

### Adding New Cookie Categories

2. Add load/remove functions for new scripts
3. Update `setCookiePreferences()` to handle new category
4. Add toggle in `GdprConsent.tsx` preferences modal
5. Update privacy policy with new cookie category description

### Adding New Third-Party Services
1. Document in privacy policy (Section 7)
2. Categorize cookie type (functional, analytics, marketing)
3. Create load/remove functions in `gdpr-consent.ts`
4. Update `AnalyticsLoader` to load scripts based on consent
5. Test that scripts only load after consent

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Storage
- Cookie preferences stored in localStorage (client-side only)
- No sensitive data stored in cookies or localStorage
- Consent status is not transmitted to server

### Script Loading
- All third-party scripts loaded from official CDNs
- Scripts loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking
- Scripts can be removed dynamically when consent is revoked

### Privacy
- No tracking before consent
- Anonymous IP enabled for Google Analytics
- Calendly only loads when user explicitly consents

---

## Compliance Status

### GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
✅ **Compliant**
- Explicit consent required for non-essential cookies
- Granular control over cookie categories
- Easy withdrawal of consent
- Clear information about data processing

### ePrivacy Directive (Cookie Law)
✅ **Compliant**
- Cookie consent obtained before setting non-essential cookies
- Essential cookies clearly identified
- User can manage preferences at any time

### CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)
✅ **Compliant**
- Privacy policy includes data collection disclosure
- User can opt-out of analytics tracking
- Contact information provided for privacy requests
