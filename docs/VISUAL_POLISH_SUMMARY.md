### 6. ✅ Verified Existing Features

**Hero Section** (Already Implemented):
- ✅ Gradient background: `bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-50 via-white to-blue-100 dark:from-gray-900 dark:to-gray-800`
- ✅ Framer Motion animations on all elements

- ✅ Mobile-friendly stacking

**All Sections** (Already Implemented):

## Visual Consistency Checklist

✅ **Typography:** Consistent heading sizes and weights across sections
✅ **Spacing:** Uniform `py-24 md:py-32` section padding
✅ **Colors:** Cohesive color palette with proper dark mode support
✅ **Animations:** Smooth transitions with `duration-0.6` for entrance effects
✅ **Mobile:** All components responsive with proper breakpoints
✅ **Trust Signals:** Badges, logos, and certification indicators
✅ **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Performance Considerations

- ✅ Optimized SVG files (trust badges and OG image)
- ✅ Lazy-loaded animations with `whileInView`
- ✅ No additional heavy dependencies (Framer Motion already in use)
- ✅ Efficient Tailwind classes with no redundancy

## Browser & Device Testing Recommendations

1. **Mobile Responsiveness:**
   - Test logo sizing on screens < 640px
   - Verify trust badges stack properly on small screens
   - Confirm hero buttons stack vertically on mobile

2. **Cross-Browser:**
   - Test SVG rendering (badges and OG image) in Safari, Chrome, Firefox
   - Verify gradient backgrounds render correctly
   - Check smooth scroll behavior with `scroll-mt-24`

3. **Dark Mode:**
   - Verify all color transitions
   - Check methodology card readability
   - Confirm trust badge contrast

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **OG Image:** Consider replacing the SVG with a high-quality PNG (1200x630) for better social media compatibility
2. **Trust Badges:** Add actual certification numbers/dates if available
3. **Analytics:** Track logo and badge click interactions
4. **A/B Testing:** Test trust badge placement and styling variations
